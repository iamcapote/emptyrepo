# ASHI Dashboard Project

This repository contains the **ASHI Dashboard**, a mystical dashboard that transforms practical system monitoring into an ancient consciousness experience, with seamless AI agent integration capabilities.

## 🌌 Project Overview

The ASHI (Ancient Sentient Hyperdimensional Interface) Dashboard is a fully functional, beautifully animated web interface that combines:
- **Stunning Mathematical Visualizations** - Mandelbulb fractals, parametric surfaces, torus geometries
- **Real-time System Monitoring** - CPU, memory, network, security metrics with mystical naming
- **Interactive User Interface** - Thought transmission, live trace feeds, responsive design
- **Ancient Cosmic Aesthetic** - Feels like operating an alien artifact

## ✨ Current Status (July 2025)

### 🎯 **FULLY FUNCTIONAL**
- ✅ All animations working (void background, mandelbulb, torus, spiral, metrics)
- ✅ Complete interactivity (input field, trace buttons, live updates)
- ✅ Mobile responsive design
- ✅ Real-time data feeds and notifications
- ✅ Robust error handling and debugging
- ✅ Beautiful mystical styling with runic overlays

### 📊 **Features Completed**
- **Visual Components**: 6 different animated mathematical surfaces
- **User Interaction**: Thought transmission with validation and feedback  
- **Live Updates**: Auto-populating trace feed with system activities
- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Error Handling**: Detailed debugging and connection monitoring
